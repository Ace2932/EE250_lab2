## Lab Question Answers
Question 1: How did the reliability of UDP change when you added 50% loss to your local
environment? Why did this occur?
In the UDP, only half of the packets got received because it doesn't confirm that all items being sent make it to their location.

Question 2: How did the reliability and speed of the TCP response change? Why might this happen?
The speed of the TCP decreased but it was just as reliable. This is because it ensures that all packets make it to the intended location no matter how many times it has to resend them.
